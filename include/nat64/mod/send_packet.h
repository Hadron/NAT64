 * We need this because the kernel assumes that when a packet enters a module, a packet featuring
 * the same layer-3 protocol exits the module. So we can't just morph IPv4 packets into IPv6 ones
 * and vice-versa; we need to ask the kernel to drop the original packets and send new ones on our
 * own.
